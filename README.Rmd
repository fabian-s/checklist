# checklist

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Inspired by projects like [`{goodpractice}`](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/goodpractice) and [`{checkers}`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/checkers), this package implements a semi-automated checklist for scripts and program files.  

It's ostensible primary purpose is to help people in my programming classes write better
code (i.e, come to grip with me being uptight and obsessive-compulsive).  
It's actual primary purpose is to save me from having to write out repetitive nagging comments about sloppy homework.

## Installation
